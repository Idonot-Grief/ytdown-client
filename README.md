# ytdown-client
A client that has an easy to use GUI for downloading Youtube videos for free.

You can download single videos and download them as a batch using playlist urls or manual adding. You can select different formats to download in and different quallity settings. No premium garbage. Just free. Shows thumbnails, creator, length, and name of the videos and let's you set download directories. Downloads are super fast becaue they are not proxied through remote servers.
